Be wise in using it please.

Anyway, this allows for Blender to export scripted scenes without the need to invoke the editor and this way, there can be upto and including user generated scripted game content/scenes.

Editor and deployed apps hosted locally using the proprietary Electron app toolchain developed for this project.
