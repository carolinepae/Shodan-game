Please use the magical Blender plugin that takes text from a file within the editor, packs it into a Javascript oneliner bytenode (if selected) and then adds it into the modlel's userData field and this engine then executes it.

Be wise in using it please.

Anyway, this allows for Blender to export scripted scenes without the need to invoke the editor and this way, there can be upto and including user generated scripted game content/scenes.
